Well The game uses C# RNG so predicting what card or number will be next is completely fucking impossible but my implementation would probably give u a 70/75 % of winning every game also has some 
more features like auto-accept so u can peacefully go afk after having the bot on and it will accept and deal all ur bets without making u idle in game, has auto-talk did some implementation of ready-made arrays 
so if anyone pings you to bot-check or afk-check you then the bot auto sends a number index of array message so u dont get caught using my bot 
ping feature too so it pings whenever the bot auto accepts and wins different soundeffect for both 
min-max bet accepting options for the bet to auto-accept
the gui is fucking cool as shit first time using css with java
